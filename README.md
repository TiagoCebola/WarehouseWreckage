## Project

**Warehouse Wreckage** is a physics-based game where the player can unleash their destructive impulses in a realistic 3D environment. The game features a unique weapon, which is a projectable wreckage ball that is limited to 20 uses and can be used to create the chaos in a warehouse. The game is developed using Unreal Engine 5, which allows for stunning graphics and realistic physics simulations. The game aims to provide a fun and satisfying experience for players who enjoy destruction and mayhem.

This is what i have learnt with this project:

- Programming basics: variables, strings, references, functions
- Object Oriented basics: objects/structures, classes, member functions
- Unreal basics: maps, actors, components, transforms, vectors
- Blueprint basics: nodes, pins
